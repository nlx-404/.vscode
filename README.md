## My new setup using custom css and js extension looks like this:
- Changed command palette
- Changed status bar
- Added dashboard
- Removed highlight from active tab and rounded them a bit. Also removed box shadow under tab bar when scrolling
- Made tab and explorer title bars smaller to allow for more coding space. Also changed font sizes and font weights to make them more clear
- Added colour changes for the vim extension
- Removed a few more extra icons
