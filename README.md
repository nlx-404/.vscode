## My new setup using custom css and js extension looks like this:
- Changed command palette
- Changed status bar
- Added dashboard
- Removed highlight from active tab and rounded them a bit
- Made tab and explorer title bars smaller to allow for more coding space
- Added colour changes for the vim extension
- Removed a few more extra icons
